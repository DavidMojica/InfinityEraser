            <li>The INFINITY ERASER is more durable than other erasers. It lasts longer and can be used multiple times without losing its effectiveness.</li> <br>
            <li>Unlike other erasers that can leave behind smudges or residue, the INFINITY ERASER can completely remove any marks, including pencil graphite, pen or marker ink, and even permanent marker.</li> <br>
            <li>The INFINITY ERASER is more effective than board erasers. It can erase any type of marks on any surface, not just chalk on a blackboard.</li> <br>
            <li>The INFINITY ERASER is much more ergonomic than those used by teachers. It is compact and easy to use, making it perfect for people of all ages and sizes.</li> <br>
            <li>Teacher erasers are usually designed to erase chalk from a blackboard, which is not as common these days. The INFINITY ERASER is designed to erase all types of marks, including those made by pens and markers.</li> <br>
